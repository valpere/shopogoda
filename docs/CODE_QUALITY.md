# Code Quality & Coverage Standards

This document outlines the code quality standards and coverage requirements for the ShoPogoda project.

## Coverage Requirements

### Current Status
- **Current Coverage**: ~28.2%
- **Minimum Threshold (main branch)**: 25%
- **Minimum Threshold (PRs)**: 20%
- **Aspirational Target**: 60%

### Coverage Thresholds by Branch

| Branch | Minimum Coverage | Status |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| `main` | 25% | âœ… Enforced in CI |
| `develop` | 20% | âœ… Enforced in CI |
| PRs | 20% | âœ… Enforced in PR checks |

### Coverage Improvement Plan

We're progressively increasing coverage requirements:

1. **Phase 1** (Current): 25% on main, 20% on PRs
2. **Phase 2** (Target Q2 2025): 40% on main, 35% on PRs
3. **Phase 3** (Target Q4 2025): 60% on main, 55% on PRs

## Code Quality Checks

### 1. Cyclomatic Complexity

**Tool**: `gocyclo`
**Threshold**: Functions with complexity > 15 trigger warnings

Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of independent paths through code. High complexity indicates:
- Functions that are hard to test
- Increased likelihood of bugs
- Difficulty in maintenance

**How to check locally:**
```bash
go install github.com/fzipp/gocyclo/cmd/gocyclo@latest
gocyclo -over 15 .
```

**Best practices:**
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Extract complex logic into smaller helper functions
- Aim for complexity < 10 for most functions

### 2. Code Duplication

**Tool**: `dupl`
**Threshold**: Blocks > 100 tokens

Code duplication leads to:
- Increased maintenance burden
- Inconsistent bug fixes
- Larger codebase

**How to check locally:**
```bash
go install github.com/mibk/dupl@latest
dupl -threshold 100 ./...
```

**Best practices:**
- Extract common logic into shared functions
- Use interfaces for polymorphic behavior
- Consider design patterns (Strategy, Template Method)

### 3. Performance Benchmarks

**Tool**: `benchstat`
**Regression Threshold**: >10% performance degradation triggers warnings

Continuous performance monitoring ensures:
- No unintended performance regressions
- Optimization efforts are measurable
- Performance-critical code is tracked

**How to run benchmarks locally:**
```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem -benchtime=3s ./...
```

**Benchmark comparison:**
```bash
# Save baseline
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./... > old.txt

# Make changes, then compare
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./... > new.txt
benchstat old.txt new.txt
```

### 4. Static Analysis

**Tools**:
- `golangci-lint`: Comprehensive linter suite
- `staticcheck`: Advanced static analysis
- `go vet`: Standard Go analysis

**How to run locally:**
```bash
# Quick check
make lint

# Comprehensive check
golangci-lint run --timeout=5m

# Static analysis
staticcheck ./...
```

### 5. Security Scanning

**Tools**:
- `gosec`: Security-focused Go analyzer
- `govulncheck`: Go vulnerability database checker
- `trivy`: Container and filesystem vulnerability scanner

**How to run locally:**
```bash
# Security scan
gosec ./...

# Vulnerability check
govulncheck ./...

# Docker image scan
trivy image shopogoda:latest
```

## Automated Quality Gates

### Pull Request Checks

Every PR automatically runs:
1. âœ… Code formatting check (`gofmt`)
2. âœ… Go vet
3. âœ… Linter (only new issues)
4. âœ… Cyclomatic complexity check
5. âœ… Code duplication detection
6. âœ… Unit tests with race detection
7. âœ… Coverage check (â‰¥20%)
8. âœ… Security scan
9. âœ… Conventional commit message format
10. âœ… Breaking change detection

### Main Branch Checks

Merges to `main` additionally run:
1. âœ… Full test suite (unit + integration)
2. âœ… Performance benchmarks with regression detection
3. âœ… Docker image build and security scan
4. âœ… CodeQL analysis
5. âœ… Coverage check (â‰¥25%)

### Weekly Code Quality Analysis

Every Monday at 3 AM UTC, a comprehensive code quality report is generated:
- Code complexity trends
- Duplication analysis
- Spelling checks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code metrics (LOC, test coverage)

**View reports**: Actions â†’ Code Quality Analysis â†’ Artifacts

## Dependency Management

**Dependabot** is configured to automatically:
- Check for Go module updates (weekly)
- Check for GitHub Actions updates (weekly)
- Check for Docker base image updates (weekly)
- Create PRs with dependency updates
- Label PRs appropriately

**Configuration**: `.github/dependabot.yml`

## Local Development Workflow

### Before Committing

```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Run linter
make lint

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Check security
gosec ./...
govulncheck ./...
```

### Pre-Push Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass (`make test`)
- [ ] Coverage meets minimum threshold
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] No security issues
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] No high-complexity functions added

### Running Full CI Locally

```bash
make ci-local
```

This runs the complete CI pipeline locally before pushing.

## Contributing to Quality Improvements

### Adding Tests

When adding tests:
1. Test both success and error paths
2. Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
3. Mock external dependencies
4. Aim for 80%+ coverage for new code
5. Include edge cases and boundary conditions

### Refactoring for Quality

When refactoring:
1. Extract complex functions into smaller ones
2. Reduce cyclomatic complexity
3. Eliminate code duplication
4. Add tests before refactoring
5. Verify benchmarks don't regress

### Reviewing PRs

Quality checklist for reviewers:
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Coverage hasn't decreased
- [ ] No new high-complexity functions
- [ ] No security warnings introduced
- [ ] Performance benchmarks reviewed (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
